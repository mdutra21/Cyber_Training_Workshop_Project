A list of python (.py) files needed to run the QTAG algorithm with Libra:

QTAG_main.py
Main file for running the code, executed with "python QTAG_main.py".

QTAG_prop.py
Module containing propagation routines (currently only symplectic propagator is coded).

QTAG_pots.py
Module containing potential functions for model systems (currently only a Holstein-like model is coded).

QTAG_calc.py
Module containing low-level computation functions necessary for running.

QTAG_init.py
Module containing initialization functions, including where parameters are set (in lieu of a parameter file currently).
